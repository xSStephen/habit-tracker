After more than a year of absence on the coding world because of some health issues, I'm back.

And oh boy the struggle is so real. I feel like I've forgot everything I've learned in the past years.

It's so hard and overwhelming to get back on the horse, but I know I can do it. I just need to be patient and consistent.
